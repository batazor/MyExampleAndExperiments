# This is bind mounted into the kubelet rootfs and all rkt shell-outs go
# through this rkt wrapper. It essentially enters the host mount namespace
# (which it is already in) only for the purpose of breaking out of the chroot
# before calling rkt. It makes things like rkt gc work and avoids bind mounting
# in certain rkt filesystem dependancies into the kubelet rootfs. This can
# eventually be obviated when the write-api stuff gets upstream and rkt gc is
# through the api-server. Related issue:
